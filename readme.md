# Rogue like tutorial

This repo contains the work from the tutorial that has you build a rogue like game in python, it is based off of the following [site](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/).

## Requirements

There are some system requirements as well as some python package requirements.

### System

Ensure that you have (depending on your system) sdl2 installed, for example - on Ubuntu, I had to run the following,

```console
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

### Python

I created a virtual environment and as such have my python requirements in my `requirements.txt` file.
